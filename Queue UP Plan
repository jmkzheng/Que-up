Website:
•	Directed towards businesses in restaurant + grocery stores
•	Used to expedite the process for customers so they do not have to wait as long
•	Business – able to track the customers + more understanding of who their customers are and get feedback to see what they thought anonymously, really helps with improving the restaurant (paid portion to get more customer discovery/understanding)
•	Customer – able to place in their food order (used for business to track whether their inventory has enough food and to prepare the food or know when someone is coming to prepare the food earlier, helps decrease customer wait time for the food being made), 
o	Give businesses the option whether to add an option to order in advance or not, some might not need it because very fast to make and need them to be there
o	Have menus available for customer to look at in one place instead of going through all the different websites

Next steps:
•	Restaurant can write their inventory, based on the food made (see whether there is enough food and an automated process that delivers the groceries/ingredients needed when low) 
o	Have ability to make it an automated process if they want ingredients sent automatically when low or notify them when there are not enough ingredients left
•	This idea can work with smaller businesses like barbers, nail salons, etc. 

Should add opening and closing time too like only options for restaurants open.
